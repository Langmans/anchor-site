		<li class="bug_free">

			<p class="casper">* There may be bugs, but they&rsquo;ll get fixed.</p>

		<li class="global">

			<h2>Super-simple theming</h2>
			<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever used WordPress, you&rsquo;ll be able to theme Anchor within minutes. Even if you haven&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not a problem; you only need a basic knowledge of PHP to create powerful themes.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="footprint">
			<h2>A teeny-tiny footprint</h2>
			<p>Unlike the majority of behemoth systems out there, Anchor weighs in at a minuscule 200kb, uncompressed; when zipped, it&rsquo;s only 155kb &mdash; that&rsquo;s the same size as a normal JPEG image.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="pretty">
			<h2>Aesthetically-gifted</h2>
			<p>Anchor has been professionally-designed to ensure a nice, easy experience. Both the administration area and the site have a well-built design that&rsquo;s easily extensible.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="free">
			<h2>No charge</h2>
			<p>Anchor is, has, and always will be free. We won&rsquo;t ever charge for downloading, installing, licensing, or removing it. We do, however, plan to sell some premium themes in the future.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="help">
