    <p>A thank you, and congratulations, for downloading the latest version of Anchor. In a flash, it should be downloaded, and, provided you&rsquo;ve got PHP 5.3+ and MySQL 5+ on a web server, you should be able to upload and run the installer right away!</p>
    
    <p>Of course, this is still alpha software. If you happen to run in to any bugs or quirks, it&rsquo;d be greatly appreciated if you left an issue on the <a href="/forum">forum</a>, or our <a href="github.com/anchorcms/anchor-cms/issues">Github issues log</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Happy blogging!</p>
